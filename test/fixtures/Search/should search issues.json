          "body": "```\r\nWe should include in the README, and probably in the docs somewhere too, a list of all the \"dependencies\" of SymPy.  Now, obviously, SymPy's only dependency is Python, but there are several optional dependencies like IPython and gmpy that are not required but extent the capabilities of SymPy if they are installed. \r\n\r\nI am putting this here instead of just doing it and making a pull request because I don't know exactly how things work with things like numpy and scipy, and I also don't know if I am forgetting anything.  So far, I have this:\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental design decisions behind SymPy is that it should not have any external dependencies besides Python to install.  Therefore, the only real \"dependency\" of SymPy is an installation of Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7 (note that Python 2.4 support is deprecated and will no longer work in the next release).\r\n\r\nHowever, there are several packages that are not required to use SymPy, but that will enhance SymPy if they are installed.  These packages are:\r\n\r\n- IPython ( http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/ ).  IPython is a third party Python interactive shell that has many more features over the built-in Python interactive shell, such as tab-completetion and [what other important features should I mention here?].  If IPython is installed, isympy will automatically use it.  Otherwise, it will fall back to the regular Python interactive shell.  You can override this behavior by setting the -c option to isympy, like `isympy -c python`.\r\n\r\n- gmpy ( http://code.google.com/p/gmpy/ ). gmpy is a Python wrapper around the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP). If gmpy is installed, it may make certain operations in SymPy faster, because it will use gmpy as the ground type instead of the built-in Python ground types.  If gmpy is not installed, it will fall back to the default Python ground types.  You can override this behavior by setting the SYMPY_GROUND_TYPES environment variable, such as `SYMPY_GROUND_TYPES=python isympy`. [Note: this should be an option to isympy!]\r\n\r\n- Cython. [What exactly is the situation with Cython?]\r\n\r\n- Numpy. [Ditto]\r\n\r\n- Scipy. [Ditto]\r\n\r\n- [Code generation dependencies?]\r\n\r\n- [Other dependencies?]\r\n\r\nNote that mpmath and pyglet, our floating point and plotting libraries respectively, are included with SymPy, so it is unnecessary to install them.  Indeed, SymPy will always use the version of mpmath or pyglet that comes with SymPy, even if a newer version is installed in the system.  This is done for compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nOK, the text in [] are comments.  I need help from others writing the rest of this.  Note that I do not want to include any development dependencies here (like Sphinx), because the user does not care about that (maybe we could have that list somewhere else in our development docs).   \r\n\r\nBut basically for the others, explain what happens when they are installed and what happens when they are not (and how to override, if relevant).  \r\n\r\nI just realized that the best way to do this would be through the wiki.  So if anyone has anything to add to this, please do it at https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Dependencies .  And then when we have it finished we can add it to the README and regular docs.\r\n```\r\nOriginal issue for #5259: http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=2160\r\nOriginal author: https://code.google.com/u/asmeurer@gmail.com/\r\nReferenced issues: #4887\r\nOriginal owner: https://code.google.com/u/asmeurer@gmail.com/\r\n",

It looks like this is because \"OSTYPE\" is not set in the environment and so the check at virtualenv.py line 866 fails.\n\nAs a hack, I check both \"OSTYPE\" and \"TERM\" (diff attached).  This works for me, but I don't know how universal it is.  For example it won't work if running from inside the emacs shell (TERM=emacs).\n\nThis seems to work for easy_intall and pip in the new virtualenv, I'm not sure if there are other issues.\n\n---------------------------------------\n- Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/ianb/virtualenv/issue/22\n- Originally Reported By:  \n- Originally Created At: 2010-02-06 21:36:32\n",

The common cause is that there is no `wsgiref.egg-info` in these installations, so `pkg_resources` doesn't find wsgiref when building its WorkingSet.\n\nFedora explicitly removes all the `.egg-info` files on line 558 of [[http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/F-12/python/python.spec?revision=1.157&view=markup#558|their spec file]], however they also [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=414711|consider that a bug and have fixed it]], so it's not clear how best to address this issue.  Workardounds just for Windows and old Fedora?

I am using 64-bit Windows 7; see also this page for similar problem with Vista:\r\n<http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/2009/08/workaround-easyinstall-windows-vanish.html>\r\nIt seems that Windows forces pip (and easy_install) to open into a new cmd shell, when run from a command shell. When the install program completes, the cmd shell closes. If there are any problems with the install, the program errors are lost, making troubleshooting difficult.\r\n\r\nThe hack of elevating to Administrator described there as working under Vista doesn't work for me on W7/64.\r\n\r\nI don't expect anyone to figure out how to keep Windows from launching into a new window, but, as a workaround: I'd like a command-line switch I can add to pip which would pause at the end of the install and print something like \"Hit any key to continue\" and then wait for that activity.",

Maybe the same problem like MIO.\n\nI made this on you advice:\n...\nAnother alternative is to leave everything as is and make sure you have a --debug option in your schwinn810.cmd . With that option you should get schwinn810.bin in your temporary folder like %USERPROFILE%\\Local Settings\\TEMP . See [2] for details. Apparently this file is incomplete but there is a chance that it has enough data for me to see what needs to be adjusted. Just send me that file.

          "body": "I use pip when I can, and it worked for me great on both Windows and Ubuntu and both Python 2.x and Python 3.x. Today I had a problem and fortunately figured it out. Here is what happened:\n\nI installed **shapely** - `pip install shapely` and it did install fine, but at the end of the process **shapely** setup suggested that I better build it with **geos** dependency for speedup.\n\nOK, I thought to remove it and get this library - `pip uninstall shapely`. Terminal showed me a long list of files and I typed *yes*.\n\nNow before I urge myself to download **geos** I wanted to finish something I was working in Python, when I get this error:\n\n```python\nImportError: No module named _socket\n```\n\nAny script that accesses network stopped working. Hm..., never had this kind of problem before, so I ask Google and get list of various scenarios none fitting my situation. Also some suggested that after a while this error fixed by itself. So as a rule of least resistance I restarted Windows, but nothing changed.\n\nNow I'll spare myself, and you too, from writing what all I did, until I hit brake and thought to focus on what change I did to my system, after this error started to show. One of the things was that I did pip install/uninstall package, but I wasn't expected that to be a problem. Browsing my %temp% folder I found `pip-_9fyh6-uninstall` folder, and looking for a clue there I just realized it removed whole **dlls** top level directory from my Python 2.7 installation!\n\nThat was unpleasant surprise, but also a relief as just copying the folder back in it's place, Python started to work as it should\n\nI use pip 1.2.1 with Python 2.7.3 on Windows XP SP3 32bit.",

          "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have been trying to get django-pyodbc working to connect to a SQL Server 2000 MSDE instance. I am using Django 1.6.1, Python 3.3 on Ubuntu 12.04.\r\n\r\nTrying to do a simple operation such as \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom django.db import connections\r\ncursor = connections['default'].cursor()\r\nresult = cursor.execute('select * from customer')\r\n```\r\n\r\ncauses the following to happen\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile \"/.../python3.3/dist-packages/django_pyodbc/base.py\", line 410, in execute\r\n    return self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\r\nTypeError: The first argument to execute must be a string or unicode query.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomeone else experienced the same problem except they were running on Windows. They asked a question on StackOverflow here:\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/21272895/cant-query-sql-server-from-django-using-django-pyodbc\r\n\r\nI tracked the problem down to line 367 in base.py:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            sql = sql.encode('utf-8')\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def format_sql(self, sql, n_params=None):\r\n        if not self.driver_supports_utf8 and isinstance(sql, text_type):\r\n            # Older FreeTDS (and other ODBC drivers?) don't support Unicode yet, so\r\n            # we need to encode the SQL clause itself in utf-8\r\n            sql = sql.encode('utf-8')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that in Python 3, str.encode returns a bytes which is not a string type causing the TypeError to occur.\r\n\r\nSee this comment on StackOverflow for information on how the string/bytes changed from Python 2 to 3.\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/11596746/1040695\r\n\r\nThis only seems to occur for the first query getting the product version. I need to do more analysis to see if happens later on.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"/.../python3.3/dist-packages/django/db/backends/__init__.py\", line 159, in cursor\r\n    cursor = util.CursorWrapper(self._cursor(), self)\r\n  File \"/.../python3.3/dist-packages/django_pyodbc/base.py\", line 290, in _cursor\r\n    if self.ops.sql_server_ver < 2005:\r\n  File \"/.../python3.3/dist-packages/django_pyodbc/operations.py\", line 31, in _get_sql_server_ver\r\n    cur.execute(\"SELECT CAST(SERVERPROPERTY('ProductVersion') as varchar)\")\r\n  File \"/.../python3.3/dist-packages/django/db/backends/util.py\", line 51, in execute\r\n    return self.cursor.execute(sql)\r\n  File \"/.../python3.3/dist-packages/django_pyodbc/base.py\", line 410, in execute\r\n    return self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\r\nTypeError: The first argument to execute must be a string or unicode query.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, my quick fix was to comment out lines 364-367 in base.py.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the bytes could be converted back to a string by changing line 367 to \r\n\r\n```\r\nsql = sql.encode('utf-8').decode('utf-8')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this helps someone workaround this bug. I don't know enough about django-pyodbc to be able to fix this properly.\r\n\r\nMichael.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If there is a space in this path, the path is quoted.\n\nHowever, when the launcher runs, it will add a second set of quotes to the path leading to an error like this:\n\n```text\nFatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using '\"\"D:\\...\\Test VEnv\\Scripts\\python.exe\"\" \"D:\\...\\Test VEnv\\Scripts\\easy_install.exe\" '\n```\n\nI believe the issue is in the launcher rather than the shebang line, since quoting that path is the only way you could support arguments as well as spaces on Windows. IMO, the launcher should not add more quotes to the shebang line when launching.\n\n\nMy repro steps (run at the command prompt):\n\n```text\nC:\\Python27\\python.exe -m virtualenv \"Test VEnv\"\ncd Test VEnv\nScripts\\python.exe -m pip install -U setuptools==4.0.1\n\nrem The current easy_install.exe was generated with setuptools 3.something and it works fine\n\nrem The next line generates a new easy_install.exe with setuptools 4.0.1 and it doesn't work\nScripts\\python.exe -m pip install -U setuptools==4.0.0\nScripts\\easy_install.exe\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\n- Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/216\n",

Starting Jython 2.2.1 shell\r\n2. Using the following commands (pg 227 in Intro to Computing and Programming in Python):\r\n>>> import sys\r\n>>> sys.path.insert(0,\"C:\\Program Files\\JES 4.3\\Sources\")\r\n>>> from media import *\r\n3. These lines cause a series of \"ClassNotFound Exceptions\" starting\r\non line 183 in media.py (in the Sources directory).\r\n\r\nIf I comment out lines 184-204 in media.py (namely the makeEmptySound function and the makeEmptySoundBySeconds function), the lines above work and I am able to use the majority of the JES library. What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Expected successful import of all items in media.py.  Get an error instead. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Using JES 4.3, Jython 2.2.1, on Windows Vista Please provide any additional information below. I should note that I had no issues utilizing the image/color functions in the library outside the JES.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/mediacomp-jes/issues/detail?id=49_",

The ensure_directory import on the same line has no issues. Checking pkg_resources.py confirms that the class ContextualZipFile does in fact exist.\n\nAlternatively, installing the python-pip package from my package manager makes everything work just fine. I'm probably being very unclear, so feel free to ping me for clarification.\n\n----------------------------------------\n- Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/252\n",

Setuptools is the best place for this as it is already inheriting the Distribution class for it's own use and can override the faulty platform name.\n\nThis works fine on Windows and I think OSX is ok as well, but that should be checked as well.\n\nWhen you run setuptools using a 32bit python on 32bit linux, the platname is still 'linux-x86_64', because distutils.util.get_platform() is using only the OS uname for determining the machine part for linux. \n\nFor most operations using setup tools, this can be overwritten on the commandline, but not on install. This becomes critical with wheel support, as now the problem becomes that pip will download and install the 64bit wheel instead of the 32bit one. There is also no way of overriding this. pip and wheels become useless. pip provides --install-options, and --general-options, but setuptools does not have install or general options for overriding the platname, like bdist and the other building commands do.\n\nOn windows distutils.util.get_platform() uses a backoff to sys.platform, which is 'win32' when running a 32bit python on a 64bit system.\n\nsetuptools is the proper place to deal with this issue. setuptools needs this fix for it's own building and installing. It is also the upstream provider of the Distribution class used by pip and wheel used for searching, converting and installing.\n\n\n[32.env] [dnapoleone@unv-dnapoleone1 numpy-1.9.1]$ which python2.7_32bit\n/home/dnapoleone/32.env/bin/python2.7_32bit\n[32.env] [dnapoleone@unv-dnapoleone1 numpy-1.9.1]$ python2.7_32bit ./setup.py bdist -h\nRunning from numpy source directory.\n/usr/lib/python2.7/distutils/dist.py:267: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'test_suite'\n  warnings.warn(msg)\nCommon commands: (see '--help-commands' for more)\n\n  setup.py build      will build the package underneath 'build/'\n  setup.py install    will install the package\n\nGlobal options:\n  --verbose (-v)  run verbosely (default)\n  --quiet (-q)    run quietly (turns verbosity off)\n  --dry-run (-n)  don't actually do anything\n  --help (-h)     show detailed help message\n  --no-user-cfg   ignore pydistutils.cfg in your home directory\n\nOptions for 'bdist' command:\n  --bdist-base (-b)  temporary directory for creating built distributions\n  --plat-name (-p)   platform name to embed in generated filenames (**default:\n                     linux-x86_64**)\n  --formats          formats for distribution (comma-separated list)\n  --dist-dir (-d)    directory to put final built distributions in [default:\n                     dist]\n  --skip-build       skip rebuilding everything (for testing/debugging)\n  --owner (-u)       Owner name used when creating a tar file [default:\n                     current user]\n  --group (-g)       Group name used when creating a tar file [default:\n                     current group]\n  --help-formats     lists available distribution formats\n\nusage: setup.py [global_opts] cmd1 [cmd1_opts] [cmd2 [cmd2_opts] ...]\n   or: setup.py --help [cmd1 cmd2 ...]\n   or: setup.py --help-commands\n   or: setup.py cmd --help\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n- Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/328\n",

          "body": "I'm working on a masterless Windows setup process on EC2 and I'm having trouble getting boto and salt-cloud working.\r\n\r\nI've installed Python 2.7.9 and added the Boto module with `pip install boto`, but when I go to import it inside of Salt, I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"c:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\boto\\exception.py\", line 28, in <module>\r\n    import xml.sax\r\nImportError: No module named sax\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think my PYTHONPATH is set correctly:\r\n\r\n```C:\\salt>echo %PYTHONPATH%\r\nC:\\Python27;C:\\Python27\\Lib;C:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages```\r\n\r\nBut Salt doesn't seem to be using it:\r\n`['C:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-amd64\\\\library.zip', 'c:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-amd64\\\\esky-0.9.8-py2.7.egg', 'c:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-amd64\\\\jinja2-2.7.1-py2.7.egg', 'c:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-amd64\\\\markupsafe-0.18-py2.7.egg', 'c:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-am64\\\\msgpack_python-0.4.2-py2.7-win-amd64.egg', 'c:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-amd64\\\\psutil-2.1.0-py2.7-win-amd64.egg', 'c:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-amd64\\\\pyzmq-14.1.1-py2.7-win-amd64.egg', 'c:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-amd64\\\\salt-2014.7.1-py2.7.egg', 'c:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-amd64\\\\setuptools-1.1.6-py2.7.egg', 'c:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-amd64\\\\wmi-1.4.9-py2.7.egg', 'C:\\\\salt\\\\salt-2014.7.1.win-amd64', 'c:\\\\Python27', 'c:\\\\Python27\\\\lib\\\\site-packages']`\r\n\r\nI assume this is something to do with how the Python library is vendored into the Salt windows installer directory.\r\n\r\nI also tried making a .egg file and dropping it into the Salt directory, which had the same error until I manually shoved lib/xml/sax.pyc and lib/logging/config.pyc into the library.zip file.\r\n\r\nMy use case is that I'm want to use the salt-cloud modules (http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.cloud.html) to look up other machines in EC2 to get their IPs (rather than using a master and a mine) and also add the machine to load balancers/DNS etc.\r\n\r\nI'd like to avoid doing my own Windows fork of Salt just to add a few additional modules. Does anyone have any advice on how to do this? I really would like to be able to use additional modules with Salt, but the Windows packaging process seems to make that very difficult without putting the modules in at build time.\r\n\r\nIf I don't use salt (just import boto) from a normal python prompt, it works fine because xml.sax is in the Python Path because the library is not overridden by the zip file.\r\n\r\nI'm also looking for any guidance to adding modules to Windows minions regardless of the exact package. For example, the Softlayer module for salt-cloud (we also use Softlayer) requires that the Softlayer python package be installed, and the EC2 module for salt-cloud wants apache-libcloud. What's the best way to get these onto Windows minions?",

          "body": "Originally reported by: **acaron (Bitbucket: [acaron](http://bitbucket.org/acaron), GitHub: [acaron](http://github.com/acaron))**\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nI've been experiencing this strange error case where CTRL-C is not properly forwarded, so I started looking into the `launcher.c` file to see if I can fix it.  Turns out it can't be truly fixed (and I'll explain why shortly), but I noticed some other inconsitencies while I was looking at the code.\n\nFirst, `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent()` is called incorrectly.  The first argument should be the event to generate, not the child PID (the 2nd argument designates the target process group).  This value can only be `CTRL_C_EVENT` (0) or `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` (1), so this call is no-op unless the child process PID is 0 or 1 (impossible on Windows).  To confirm this, you can simply replace this line:\n\n    GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(child_pid,0);\n\nwith this:\n\n    if (!GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(child_pid,0)) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"failed to forward CTRL-C (error: %d).\\n\", GetLastError());\n    }\n\nThis will consistenly print \"failed to forward CTRL-C (error: 87).\" every time you press CTRL-C (87 is \"invalid parameter\").\n\nSecond, it should not be called at all.  The CTRL-C event is automatically sent to all processes in the same process group, which means that the child process gets the CTRL-C even if you stop generating the event.  In addition, if you fix the call to this:\n\n    GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(control_type, 0);\n\nand add a print statement in the console control handler, you will notice that both the launcher and the child process get the CTRL-C event more than once because the launcher is sending this signal to itself, which creates a quasi infinite feedback loop (the control handler is run in a special background thread so a race condition allows it to terminate after the launcher has been spamming itself for a while).\n\nThird, the console control handler should return `FALSE` for control events it doesn't handle.  The current implementation returns `TRUE` even if the event is not CTRL-C.\n\nLast, if `CreateProcessA()` or `GetExitCodeProcess()` fail, the launcher returns 0 as the exit status which is misleading for the calling program.\n\nNow, to get back to my original problem: if you use the launcher to start a Python script which stops when there is no more input, like this:\n\n    try:\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        while line:\n            # ...\n            line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n       pass\n    finally:\n       print 'Cleaning up.'\n\nand you terminate this script using CTRL-C, sometimes the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception is raised in the `finally` handler.  AFAICT, there is a race condition that's caused by Windows: pressing CTRL-C shuts down the standard input, causing it to return an empty line before the CTRL-C event is propagated to all child processes in the process group.  To confirm this, you can add a simple sleep after exhausting the standard input, which lets the time for the system to propagate the CTRL-C event and ensures Python's `KeyboardInterrupt` exception is raised before the program's shutdown sequence starts.\n\n    try:\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        while line:\n            # ...\n            line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        # Ensure we get the CTRL-C events on Windows when launched\n        # through a distribute/setuptools wrapper executable.\n        if os.name == 'nt':\n            time.sleep(25)\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n       pass\n    finally:\n       print 'Cleaning up.'\n\nAFAICT, there is no known way to fix this race condition in the setuptools launcher.  However, it would be nice if this quirk was documented as a known problem.\n\nI wrote a pair of C programs to investigate this issue.  I'm attaching them in case someone wants to experiment with the errors I'm reporting.\n\nCheers,\n\nAndré\n\n----------------------------------------\n- Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/337\n",

          "body": "Hello all, I just found out about xonsh yesterday and have been checking it out.  After installing it (cloned from github, then used pip install . in the cloned directory) my first discovery was that it wasn't put anywhere on my path.  Then I found the 'xonsh' script in the scripts directory.  Upon executing it, I get:\r\n\r\n/usr/bin/env: python -u: No such file or directory\r\n\r\nThe problem is the shebang at the top of the script.  It called /usr/bin/env python -u.  Aside from the fact that 'python' on my system will get you Python 2.7 and Python 3 is called python3 (a common configuration when legacy and current Python are both installed), the real issue is that using parameters like that in a shebang doesn't work on many systems.  After doing some reading, it appears that this would work OK on OSX but fail on most (if not all) Linux systems.  The system processes \"python -u\" as a single string and looks for an executable with that whole name.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how you'd like this fixed.  Personally I set the PYTHONUNBUFFERED environment variable to 1 before launching the script after changing the shebang to be #!/usr/bin/env python3.  I don't think that's a good general answer, though.  It would fail on systems which have python3 as just 'python' and not guarantee unbuffered access.  Perhaps the disabling of buffering should be handled in code?",

Certainly, it wouldn't be as good as multiprocessing but at least it's more stable.\r\n\r\nbtw the most recent versions I've had the same problem on are:\r\n- Mac OS 10.9.5\r\n- Python 3.4.3 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc.\r\n- scikit-learn==0.16.1\r\n- scipy==0.16.0\r\n- numpy==1.9.2\r\n- pandas==0.16.2\r\n- joblib==0.8.4",

That being said I am having an unusual issue and I think I've narrowed it down to pyreadline. \r\n\r\nI am running windows 7 Miniconda3 python 3.4.3 64 bit and here are the steps I do to recreate the issue.\r\n\r\n    conda create -n shelltest -c scopatz xonsh\r\n\r\nIt then asks me to install the follwoing which I say yes.\r\n\r\n    The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:\r\n\r\n    pip:        7.1.2-py34_0\r\n    ply:        3.7-py34_0\r\n    python:     3.4.3-0\r\n    setuptools: 18.3.2-py34_0\r\n    wheel:      0.26.0-py34_1\r\n    xonsh:      0.2.0-py34_1\r\n\r\nEverything installs as expected so I run \"Activate shelltest\" to activate my virtualenv and type \"xonsh\" to run my xonsh shell and get the following prompt:\r\n\r\n    ☺←[1;32m☻jsarver@mycomputername☺←[1;34m☻ ~☺←[1;32m☻ ☺←[1;34m☻$☺←[0m☻\r\n\r\nSoo..

After some fooling around I discoverd if I install pyreadline then run xonsh I get this prompt:\r\n\r\n    jsarver@mycomputername ~ $\r\n\r\nOk now things are looking up, but now if I try to utilize any multiline functionality like defining a function in the xonsh command line like so:\r\n\r\n    def foo():\r\n\r\nI get the following error.\r\n\r\n    jsarver@mycomputername ~ $ def foo():\r\n    pre_input_hook failed\r\n    Readline internal error\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"C:\\Miniconda3\\envs\\shelltest\\lib\\site-packages\\pyreadline\\modes\\basemode.py\", line 124, in readline_setup\r\n        self.pre_input_hook()\r\n      File \"C:\\Miniconda3\\envs\\shelltest\\lib\\site-packages\\xonsh\\readline_shell.py\", line 81, in inserter\r\n        readline.redisplay()\r\n    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'redisplay'\r\n  \r\n    During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n  \r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"C:\\Miniconda3\\envs\\shelltest\\lib\\site-packages\\pyreadline\\console\\console.py\", line 768, in hook_wrapper_23\r\n        res = ensure_str(readline_hook(prompt))\r\n      File \"C:\\Miniconda3\\envs\\shelltest\\lib\\site-packages\\pyreadline\\rlmain.py\", line 569, in readline\r\n        self.readline_setup(prompt)\r\n      File \"C:\\Miniconda3\\envs\\shelltest\\lib\\site-packages\\pyreadline\\rlmain.py\", line 564, in readline_setup\r\n        BaseReadline.readline_setup(self, prompt)\r\n      File \"C:\\Miniconda3\\envs\\shelltest\\lib\\site-packages\\pyreadline\\rlmain.py\", line 253, in readline_setup\r\n        return self.mode.readline_setup(prompt)\r\n      File \"C:\\Miniconda3\\envs\\shelltest\\lib\\site-packages\\pyreadline\\modes\\basemode.py\", line 127, in readline_setup\r\n        traceback.print_exc()\r\n    NameError: name 'traceback' is not defined\r\n    xonsh: For full traceback set: $XONSH_SHOW_TRACEBACK=True\r\n      File \"<string>\", line None\r\n    SyntaxError: None: no further code\r\n\r\nIf I uninstall pyreadline and go back to to funky looking prompt I can define functions all day and it works fine. I'm sure I can just change my prompt to not use color but feel I should report this because it doesn't seem to be working as intended. I did uninstall my python installations and reinstalled a fresh miniconda in the hopes it was just a borked python install, still no luck.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide to help troubleshoot this.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJosh\r\n",

          "body": "By enabling opendap_model in the compass_viewer, I can build HDF-compass on Linux. So I can test the opendap plug-in at least from my development environment.\r\n\r\nIn general,\r\nOne can open a URL served via DAP via \"Open Resource\".  A simple netCDF style DAP service can be opened with the following limitations.\r\n1) The current opendap model misses group attributes (at least for root) \r\n\r\nThe attributes under the root group(or global attributes) can not be displayed. It seems the feature is missing. \r\n\r\n\"\r\n  File \"/mnt/scr1/kent/hdf-compass-kent/hdf-compass/build/HDFCompass/out00-PYZ.pyz/compass_viewer.frame\", line 388, in on_menu_reopen\r\n  File \"/mnt/scr1/kent/hdf-compass-kent/hdf-compass/build/HDFCompass/out00-PYZ.pyz/opendap_model\", line 272, in __init__\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'attributes'\r\n\r\nNote: Pydap client  on the command-line can successfully retrieve the global attribute. So this is an issue related to the opendap model. \r\nPydap output is as follows:\r\n>>> dataset = open_url('http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc')\r\n>>> print dataset.attributes\r\n{'NC_GLOBAL': {'history': 'FERRET V4.30 (debug/no GUI) 15-Aug-96'}, 'DODS_EXTRA'\r\n: {'Unlimited_Dimension': 'TIME'}}\r\n\r\nI think it is promising to fix this issue. It seems the opendap_model just forgets considering the global attribute case.\r\n\r\n2) Can not serve any object names that contain special characters\r\n\r\n The opendap plug-in can only address the object names that include underscore,letter and numeric values(CF naming conventions). So essentially all HDF5 data served by the default option of the Hyrax OPeNDAP services can not be served since a \"/\" is always included in an HDF5 object name. \r\nSymptom: the plug-in just opens the file without displaying any objects. The file name displayed by the plug-in looks like to be escaped with %...h5 for the dot in an HDF5 file name. \r\n\r\nPydap command-line client doesn't have an issue to open an HDF5 file served by the default HDF5 handler although I may see %.. displayed for the special characters inside the variable names.\r\n\r\n3)  Can and potentially will not serve compound datatype objects well because of the limitation of pydap\r\n\r\nMy version of the pydap(installed by using pip) can only handle a scalar compound datatype HDF5 dataset. So we should NOT expect the opendap module to be able to serve compound datatype objects well even if bugs are fixed.\r\n",

          "body": "I recently tried ran into problems downloading and installing Python packages which, after a great deal of time and effort, I have isolated to a bug with the --isolated command line option. In short, it would appear that when you perform operations with PIP using this option, a unique parameter is handed off to the distutils package which is invalid: --no-user-cfg.\r\n\r\nIn my case I'm running on a Windows 7 environment, using Python 3.2, PIP v7.1.2 and the latest version of setuptools v20.0. For a very simple use case consider the following:\r\n\r\n 1. install Python 3.2 (32 and 64bit both seem to behave the same)\r\n 2. install PIP 7.1.2 (ie: download the get-pip.py from the PIP website and do a \"python get-pip.py \"pip<8\")\r\n 3. try installing a package such as \"coverage\" using the isolated flag (ie: pip --isolated install coverage)\r\n\r\n**Results:** you will get an odd-looking error message that looks like this:\r\n\r\n> Collecting coverage\r\n>   Downloading coverage-4.0.3.tar.gz (354kB)\r\n>     100% |################################| 356kB 3.7MB/s\r\n>     Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:\r\n>     usage: -c [global_opts] cmd1 [cmd1_opts] [cmd2 [cmd2_opts] ...]\r\n>        or: -c --help [cmd1 cmd2 ...]\r\n>        or: -c --help-commands\r\n>        or: -c cmd --help\r\n> \r\n>     error: option --no-user-cfg not recognized\r\n\r\nConversely, if you attempt the install without the \"--isolated\" flag, the operation completes successfully.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some digging I've isolated the problem to lines 174-177 in the \"distutils_scheme\" function found in the \"Lib\\site-packages\\pip\\locations.py\" script which look as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if isolated:\r\n        extra_dist_args = {\"script_args\": [\"--no-user-cfg\"]}\r\n    else:\r\n        extra_dist_args = {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would appear that, when this option is set it passes along a \"--no-user-cfg\" option to the distutils package which, according to the error output, is not a valid option supported by distutils.\r\n\r\nThis error doesn't occur for all Python packages, but I have reproduced it on several. If I'm not mistaken the commonality between all of them is that they are all tar-balls containing source projects that then have certain \"egg\" operations performed on them. Perhaps this will help further isolate and repair the issue.\r\n\r\nBelow are a list of several of the other packages I've reproduced this problem with:\r\n\r\n- coverage v4.0.3 (needed by pytest-cov)\r\n- lazy-object-proxy v1.2.1 (needed by astroid 1.1.1, a transitive dependency of PyLint)\r\n- Jinja2 v2.6 (needed by sphinx)\r\n- MarkupSafe (needed by Jinja2 v2.8)\r\n- logilab-common\r\n- PyLint v1.3.1 (last version of PyLint to officially support Python 3.2)\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, many of the very common Python packages used by anyone under these conditions will be completely unusable. As such I'd strongly encourage you to escalate this issue so it can be fixed sooner rather than later.\r\n",

          "body": "Hi, I would like to report an unexpected behaviour connected with option error_bad_lines (I just reference this for make it easier to find this bug if someone was to report the same).\r\n\r\nGiven the following two CSV files:\r\nsimple.csv\r\n```\r\nCol1,Col2\r\n4,Here\r\n5,7,Invalid\r\n8,Row\r\n9,Does\r\n10,Break\r\n```\r\n\r\nsimple2.csv\r\n```\r\nCol1,Col2\r\n5,7,Invalid\r\n4,Row\r\n8,Does\r\n9,Not\r\n10,Break\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following code breaks, as expected:\r\n```\r\ndf = pd.read_csv('simple.csv')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fact that the following code does not break is up to discussion (though it is inconsistent depending on whether an error is in first row or futher ones):\r\n```\r\ndf2 = pd.read_csv('simple2.csv')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the index is read as the first column and hence it comes down to another potential issue reported (ragarding erroring on too few values), so I am not going into this here.\r\n\r\nSo the result is as follows:\r\n```\r\n\tCol1\t\tCol2\r\n5\t7\t\tInvalid\r\n4\tRow\t\tNaN\r\n8\tDoes\tNaN\r\n9\tNot\t\tNaN\r\n10\tBreak\tNaN\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever even if I specify explicitly, that there is no index in CSV:\r\n```\r\ndf3 = pd.read_csv('simple2.csv', index_col=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt still works, yielding the result:\r\n```\r\n\tCol1   \tCol2\r\n0\t5 \t\t7\r\n1\t4 \t\tRow\r\n2\t8\t\tDoes\r\n3\t9\t\tNot\r\n4\t10\t\tBreak\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is definitely a bug I believe. I discovered it by accident, as in CSV that I was about to read comma was used also as decimal separator in first column and the totally corrupted CSV ended up read and parsed as DataFrame.\r\n#### output of ``pd.show_versions()``\r\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\r\n------------------\r\ncommit: None\r\npython: 3.5.1.final.0\r\npython-bits: 64\r\nOS: Windows\r\nOS-release: 7\r\nmachine: AMD64\r\nprocessor: Intel64 Family 6 Model 60 Stepping 3, GenuineIntel\r\nbyteorder: little\r\nLC_ALL: None\r\nLANG: None\r\n\r\npandas: 0.17.1\r\nnose: 1.3.7\r\npip: 8.0.3\r\nsetuptools: 20.1.1\r\nCython: 0.23.4\r\nnumpy: 1.10.1\r\nscipy: 0.16.0\r\nstatsmodels: 0.6.1\r\nIPython: 4.0.1\r\nsphinx: 1.3.1\r\npatsy: 0.4.0\r\ndateutil: 2.4.2\r\npytz: 2015.7\r\nblosc: None\r\nbottleneck: 1.0.0\r\ntables: 3.2.2\r\nnumexpr: 2.4.4\r\nmatplotlib: 1.5.0\r\nopenpyxl: 2.2.6\r\nxlrd: 0.9.4\r\nxlwt: 1.0.0\r\nxlsxwriter: 0.7.7\r\nlxml: 3.4.4\r\nbs4: 4.4.1\r\nhtml5lib: None\r\nhttplib2: None\r\napiclient: None\r\nsqlalchemy: 1.0.9\r\npymysql: None\r\npsycopg2: None\r\nJinja2: 2.8\r\n",

It looks like as if pandas was dropping the timezone info (ie doing its calculation on the UTC values) and then localizing the date to the original timezone,i.e. doing something like\r\n`column_with_UTC_dates_in_naive_format.tz_localize(timezone)`\r\ninstead of \r\n`column_with_UTC_dates_in_naive_format.tz_localize(\"UTC\").tz_convert(timezone)`\r\n\r\nThis buggy behavior is even more striking when running the sample with\r\n`idx = pandas.date_range(\"2016-03-27\", \"2016-03-29\", freq=\"H\", closed=\"left\", tz=\"Europe/Brussels\")` (cover the DST change) as the naive UTC date \"2016-03-27 03:00\" cannot be localized to the timezone  as it is not recognized. In this case, the dtype of the column is not anymore datetime64[ns, timezone] but just int64.\r\n\r\n#### Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible\r\n```\r\n# create a DataFrame with a \"time\" column filled with localized datetime64 on hourly basis\r\nidx = pandas.date_range(\"2016-01-01\", \"2016-01-03\", freq=\"H\", closed=\"left\",tz=\"Europe/Brussels\")\r\ndf = pandas.Series(idx, index=idx, name=\"time\").to_frame()\r\n# calculate some min and max of \"time\" column per hour of the day\r\ndf_agg = df.groupby(idx.hour).aggregate([\"min\",\"max\"])\r\ndf_agg.info()\r\nprint df_agg\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected Output\r\n```\r\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\r\nDatetimeIndex: 48 entries, 2016-01-01 00:00:00+01:00 to 2016-01-02 23:00:00+01:00\r\nFreq: H\r\nData columns (total 1 columns):\r\ntime    48 non-null datetime64[ns, Europe/Brussels]\r\ndtypes: datetime64[ns, Europe/Brussels](1)\r\nmemory usage: 768.0 bytes\r\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\r\nInt64Index: 24 entries, 0 to 23\r\nData columns (total 2 columns):\r\n(time, min)    24 non-null datetime64[ns, Europe/Brussels]\r\n(time, max)    24 non-null datetime64[ns, Europe/Brussels]\r\ndtypes: datetime64[ns, Europe/Brussels](2)\r\nmemory usage: 576.0 bytes\r\n                        time                          \r\n                         min                       max\r\n0  2015-12-31 23:00:00+01:00 2016-01-01 23:00:00+01:00\r\n1  2016-01-01 00:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 00:00:00+01:00\r\n2  2016-01-01 01:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 01:00:00+01:00\r\n3  2016-01-01 02:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 02:00:00+01:00\r\n4  2016-01-01 03:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 03:00:00+01:00\r\n5  2016-01-01 04:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 04:00:00+01:00\r\n6  2016-01-01 05:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 05:00:00+01:00\r\n7  2016-01-01 06:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 06:00:00+01:00\r\n8  2016-01-01 07:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 07:00:00+01:00\r\n9  2016-01-01 08:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 08:00:00+01:00\r\n10 2016-01-01 09:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 09:00:00+01:00\r\n11 2016-01-01 10:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 10:00:00+01:00\r\n12 2016-01-01 11:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 11:00:00+01:00\r\n13 2016-01-01 12:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 12:00:00+01:00\r\n14 2016-01-01 13:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 13:00:00+01:00\r\n15 2016-01-01 14:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 14:00:00+01:00\r\n16 2016-01-01 15:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 15:00:00+01:00\r\n17 2016-01-01 16:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 16:00:00+01:00\r\n18 2016-01-01 17:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 17:00:00+01:00\r\n19 2016-01-01 18:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 18:00:00+01:00\r\n20 2016-01-01 19:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 19:00:00+01:00\r\n21 2016-01-01 20:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 20:00:00+01:00\r\n22 2016-01-01 21:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 21:00:00+01:00\r\n23 2016-01-01 22:00:00+01:00 2016-01-02 22:00:00+01:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### output of ``pd.show_versions()``\r\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\r\n------------------\r\ncommit: None\r\npython: 2.7.11.final.0\r\npython-bits: 32\r\nOS: Windows\r\nOS-release: 7\r\nmachine: AMD64\r\nprocessor: Intel64 Family 6 Model 61 Stepping 4, GenuineIntel\r\nbyteorder: little\r\nLC_ALL: None\r\nLANG: None\r\n\r\npandas: 0.18.0\r\nnose: 1.3.7\r\npip: 8.1.1\r\nsetuptools: 20.6.7\r\nCython: None\r\nnumpy: 1.10.4\r\nscipy: 0.17.0\r\nstatsmodels: 0.6.1\r\nxarray: None\r\nIPython: None\r\nsphinx: None\r\npatsy: 0.4.0\r\ndateutil: 2.5.0\r\npytz: 2016.1\r\nblosc: None\r\nbottleneck: None\r\ntables: 3.2.2\r\nnumexpr: 2.4.6\r\nmatplotlib: 1.5.1\r\nopenpyxl: 2.3.2\r\nxlrd: 0.9.4\r\nxlwt: None\r\nxlsxwriter: None\r\nlxml: None\r\nbs4: None\r\nhtml5lib: None\r\nhttplib2: None\r\napiclient: None\r\nsqlalchemy: 1.0.12\r\npymysql: None\r\npsycopg2: None\r\njinja2: 2.8\r\nboto: None\r\nNone\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "I came across a SEED dataless file which had time set to `24:00:00.0000` in epoch time spans. Even if to some extent it might make sense to indicate the the time span ends with that day, according to the SEED Manual this is not really standard compliant. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, some programs seems not to enforce this or are resilient, e.g. PDCC and some seiscomp tools. What adds a bit to the confusion and makes it difficult to understand the issue is that Obspy in such a case just silently ignores the value. So if the time is supposed to close an epoch, the parse representation is interpreted as an open ended epoch.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would propose that the behavior wrt parsing invalid datetime value is somewhat modified. I see the following possibilities:\r\n * generate a warning or even an error so that it becomes obvious that the file is not fully compliant;\r\n * accept some invalid values;\r\n * accept some invalid values and generate a warning;\r\n\r\nNo clear idea what is the best, therefore I start this with as issue.

Since Windows (or any NTFS file system) handles symlinks very awkwardly, calling the symbolic `_postpic_version.py` link in the main directory fails.\r\nLuckily, this can be overcome easily by rewriting line 26 of setup.py\r\n`import _postpic_version`\r\nto\r\n`from postpic import _postpic_version`\r\nsince the `__init.py__`  in the postpic subfolder is properly set up.\r\nI am not sure whether this invokes additional problems, but to me it seems like a proper and easy solution.\r\n\r\n2.  However, installation on windows still requires a Windows c++ python compiler, e.g. the Microsoft VisualC++ compiler available for python2.7 and python 3.x.\r\n\r\n3.  After getting through the items above, still the installation routine could not call the cython libraries included in python(x,y). I was not able to track this down, probably it is an issue how python(x,y) implements those libraries. However, I recognize that this should not change postpic's functionality.\r\n\r\nFinally, I feel the need for appreciating that the installation on my personal Ubuntu machine ran as smoothly as it could ever be. However, providing support for Windows might open postpic up to a broader range of users.\r\nedit: I seem to be not able to add labels to this issue, my apologies",

          "body": "When a DataFrame column is constructed from timezone-aware datetime objects, its `values` attribute returns a `pandas.DatetimeIndex` instead of a 2D numpy array. This is problematic because the datetime index does not support all operations that a numpy array does.\r\n\r\n#### Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport datetime\r\nimport dateutil\r\nimport pandas\r\nimport numpy as np\r\ndf = pandas.DataFrame()\r\ndf['Time'] = [datetime.datetime(2015,1,1,tzinfo=dateutil.tz.tzutc())]\r\ndf.dropna(axis=0) # raises ValueError: 'axis' entry is out of bounds\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, `print df.values` returns `DatetimeIndex(['2015-01-01'], dtype='datetime64[ns, UTC]', freq=None)`.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Output\r\n\r\nThe `df.dropna` call should be a no-op.\r\n\r\nCompare this to the case when constructed using `df['Time'] = [datetime.datetime(2015,1,1)]`. In that case, `df.dropna` works as expected, and `df.values` is `array([['2014-12-31T16:00:00.000000000-0800']], dtype='datetime64[ns]')`.\r\n\r\n#### output of ``pd.show_versions()``\r\n\r\n```\r\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\r\n------------------\r\ncommit: None\r\npython: 2.7.11.final.0\r\npython-bits: 64\r\nOS: Windows\r\nOS-release: 7\r\nmachine: AMD64\r\nprocessor: Intel64 Family 6 Model 63 Stepping 2, GenuineIntel\r\nbyteorder: little\r\nLC_ALL: None\r\nLANG: None\r\n\r\npandas: 0.18.1\r\nnose: None\r\npip: 8.0.2\r\nsetuptools: 20.1.1\r\nCython: 0.23.4\r\nnumpy: 1.10.4\r\nscipy: 0.17.0\r\nstatsmodels: 0.6.1\r\nxarray: None\r\nIPython: 4.1.1\r\nsphinx: 1.3.5\r\npatsy: 0.4.0\r\ndateutil: 2.4.2\r\npytz: 2015.7\r\nblosc: None\r\nbottleneck: None\r\ntables: 3.2.2\r\nnumexpr: 2.4.6\r\nmatplotlib: 1.5.1\r\nopenpyxl: 2.3.2\r\nxlrd: 0.9.4\r\nxlwt: 1.0.0\r\nxlsxwriter: None\r\nlxml: None\r\nbs4: 4.3.2\r\nhtml5lib: None\r\nhttplib2: None\r\napiclient: None\r\nsqlalchemy: 1.0.12\r\npymysql: None\r\npsycopg2: None\r\njinja2: 2.8\r\nboto: None\r\npandas_datareader: None\r\n```",
